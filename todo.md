# GitMyNotes

## to do

### bugs

* try with NO wrapper outer dir

* do not fail entire job when this applescript error occurs: `execution error: Notes got an error: An error of type 100002 has occurred. (100002)`

* get someone to write tests!!


### enhancements

* allow optionally `git push` the audit file as well

* add share code to track optional viralty?

* create self executing mac shell command to wrap around python script. 

* oss users trigger/set this up via cron or... automator?


### prep for release (technical)

* final names for everything

* make sure the .gitignore is correct

* remove 'mariochampion' from config values 

* write some measure of real instructions


### pro?

* licensing??

* create a github for non-devs one-pager? video? 

* allow comma separated list of folders at once

* command to get list of folders and counts so you can decide what to do

* pre-map some folders to some github repos

* add DEFAULT folder name so doesnt try to do ALL NOTES?? if none specified?

* help set up cron job?

* default ignore folder, so when user selects "all folder" it gets skipped
