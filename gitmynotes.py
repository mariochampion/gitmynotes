"""GitMyNotes -- back up Apple Notes (Notes.app) folders to a GitHub repo as Markdown.

For each configured folder, the script drives Notes.app via AppleScript /
osascript to export every note's HTML body, optionally converts it to GFM
Markdown via pandoc (R8), writes a per-note .md file with YAML frontmatter,
commits the result to a local git repo, and pushes to a configured GitHub
remote. A per-folder CSV append-only audit log is appended on every run.

Configuration lives in `gmn_config.yaml` next to this script. The file is
edited in-place to advance per-folder mod-date watermarks and run-count
usage totals (see update_yaml_config_multi for the single-write-per-run
guarantee). Every DEFAULT_* value can be overridden per run via CLI flags;
see `python gitmynotes.py --help` for the full list, and the USING THIS
SCRIPT block below for common invocations.

Entry points worth knowing:
  - main()                      -- single CLI run; orchestrates everything.
  - process_one_folder()        -- the per-folder pipeline (count -> export
                                   -> commit/push -> audit -> move -> restore
                                   -> watermark advance); called once
                                   normally or repeatedly under --auto.
  - export_notes_to_markdown()  -- the AppleScript driver that does the
                                   actual Notes.app export per batch.
  - applescript_escape()        -- single source of truth for escaping any
                                   user-supplied string before it's embedded
                                   into an AppleScript "..." literal

macOS-only (depends on Notes.app + osascript). External deps: `ruamel.yaml`
(pinned in requirements.txt) for round-trip config edits, and `pandoc` (a
hard prereq when DEFAULT_BODY_FORMAT is 'markdown', the default). The 'html'
escape hatch removes the pandoc prereq at the cost of raw-HTML-in-.md file.

Operational notes:
  - Non-interactive / unattended runs (Cowork routines, cron, CI): pair
    --auto with --yes. Exit codes follow the cross-cutting
    taxonomy: 0 = clean, 1 = hard failure, 2 = partial success.
  - Side-channel files (`currentnote.txt`, `metadata_rows.txt`) live next
    to this script; both are .gitignored. 
  - The append-only audit CSV per folder doubles as a backup index using ISO
    formatted dates(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

#### USING THIS SCRIPT

## Export up to 10 notes from a specific folder
#  python gitmynotes.py --folder="somefolder" --max-notes=10

## Export all notes from a specific folder
#  python gitmynotes.py --folder="somefolder"

## Specify to restore notes folder even if not emptied
#  python gitmynotes.py --folder="somefolder" --max-notes=10 --restore=always

## Long runs: every N batches (DEFAULT_LOOPCOUNT_BEFORE_CONFIRM, default 5) GitMyNotes pauses
## for a y/N/x confirmation before the next batch. Suppress with --force for interactive runs.
#  python gitmynotes.py --folder="somefolder" --max-notes=100 --force

## Unattended runs (Cowork routines, cron, CI): --yes / --non-interactive implies --force AND
## fails fast (exit 1) if gmn_config.yaml still has the <ChangeMe> GitHub URL placeholder.
#  python gitmynotes.py --folder="somefolder" --max-notes=100 --yes

## Watermark-aware backup of every folder GitMyNotes already knows about
#  python gitmynotes.py --auto --yes

## Watermark-aware backup of just one specific folder you know you've been editing
#  python gitmynotes.py --auto --folder="somefolder" --yes

## go crazy and specify nothing, to get all the defaults!
#  python gitmynotes.py

    continues into the export pipeline regardless. The rationale is that a

    """Export Notes using applescript/osascript with folder and count limits.

    notes_account scopes every Notes lookup (folder + iteration) to the specified
    account (e.g. 'iCloud', 'On My Mac'). Threaded through from --notes-account /
    DEFAULT_NOTES_ACCOUNT (R6).

    unsupported_folder_ending is the suffix appended to folder_name when the
    partial-export recovery path moves an image-bearing note to a sibling folder
    (e.g. folder 'plans' + ending '_unsupported' -> 'plans_unsupported'). Threaded
    through from DEFAULT_UNSUPPORTED_FOLDER_ENDING.

    body_format is 'markdown' or 'html' . In 'markdown' mode AppleScript writes
    each note's raw HTML body to a per-note '<cleanTitle>.html' temp file in the
    export path (no date <div> headers prepended); the caller's Python sweep then
    converts the .html to the final '<cleanTitle>.md' via pandoc and prepends YAML
    frontmatter. In 'html' mode AppleScript writes the HTML output
    directly: '<cleanTitle>.md' with the original <div>Creation/Modification
    Date</div> headers + raw HTML body, no Python conversion sweep needed.
    Either way the metadata-rows file (and thus the audit CSV) records the .md
    name, so downstream consumers stay agnostic to the mode.

    DEFAULT_METADATA_ROWS_FILE is the absolute path to the side-channel CSV file
    the AppleScript loop appends one row to per successfully-exported note
    ('title,quoted_title.md,YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'). Caller reads this file after
    the function returns and uses it to write the audit CSV. Truncated at
    function entry so stale rows from a prior batch can't pollute this one. On
    the type-100002 recovery path the file already contains rows for the
    goodnotes (1..i-1); on the success path it contains rows for all exported
    notes including stubs.

    Run once per batch from process_one_folder, after the AppleScript export

    <wrapper_dir>` rather than `git add .` so unrelated working-tree changes
    aren't accidentally captured. Commit message includes the folder name and
    timestamp.

    The "nothing to commit" case (re-exporting notes whose content is
    byte-identical to what's already in git) is classified as benign (B11):
    we still attempt a push afterward to drain any prior unpushed commits.

        repo_path (str): absolute path to the local git repo root (the export
            path, same value setup_git_repo was called with).
        folder_name (str, optional): Notes folder being committed. Threaded

                    observed (R18 data layer's beta semantics).

                    USAGE_FOLDERS_PROCESSED.

            suppressed entirely per R18 design). False for normal interactive
            runs, which keep the existing prompt behavior.

                move_processed_notes falsy after real export work).
            'aborted_by_user' (bool): True if user typed 'x' at the 5x-batch
                confirmation prompt (only possible when skip_5x_confirm=False
                AND --force / --yes is not set).
            'notes_processed' (int): total notes exported across this folder's
                batches (used by the auto loop's summary).
            'loop_count' (int): how many batches actually ran (0 means no-op,
                e.g. empty folder, --max-notes=0, or --auto count=0).
            'audit_file' (str): the audit CSV path for this folder.

    """CLI entry point. Orchestrates one GitMyNotes run end-to-end.

    Pipeline (high-level):
      1. Wire up the file logger (R4) so warning/error events from any later
         stage land in <script_dir>/gitmynotes.log.
      2. Load gmn_config.yaml via load_configs_from_file and pull every
         DEFAULT_* value into a local. Resolve DEFAULT_CURRENTNOTE_FILE (B9)
         and DEFAULT_METADATA_ROWS_FILE (R5) to absolute paths anchored to
         the script directory if the config values are relative.
      3. Validate DEFAULT_BODY_FORMAT (R8) and, in 'markdown' mode, verify
         pandoc is on PATH -- missing pandoc hard-fails the run with
         EXIT_HARD_FAILURE before any work happens.
      4. Build the argparse parser, parse args, apply --yes implications (B8:
         --yes implies --force and converts the ChangeMe-on-first-run prompt
         into a fail-fast).
      5. If DEFAULT_GITHUB_URL is still the <ChangeMe> placeholder, either
         prompt the user interactively (and update gmn_config.yaml in place)
         or fail fast under --yes / --non-interactive (B8).
      6. setup_git_repo on the export root.
      7. Bundle per-run config + mutable run_state into dicts for
         process_one_folder, then either:
           - --auto: walk USAGE_FOLDERS_PROCESSED (or the single folder named
             via --auto --folder=NAME, R18b), call count_notes_modified_since
             for each, skip folders with null watermarks (yellow warning),
             and call process_one_folder per folder with per-folder failure
             isolation (one stale folder doesn't black-hole the others).
           - non-auto: run B10 folder guard, then a single process_one_folder
             call. R18-era refactor; pre-R18 the batch loop lived inline here.
      8. After all folders, write the per-run usage counter updates to
         gmn_config.yaml in a single update_yaml_config_multi call (R10) --
         one yaml round-trip per run regardless of batch / folder count.
      9. Exit with EXIT_SUCCESS / EXIT_PARTIAL_SUCCESS per the cross-cutting
         taxonomy. Hard-failure paths sys.exit(EXIT_HARD_FAILURE) directly
         earlier and never reach this final exit.

    No args, no return value. Side effects: log writes, git operations,
    AppleScript invocations, file writes under DEFAULT_EXPORT_PATH, in-place
    edits to gmn_config.yaml.
