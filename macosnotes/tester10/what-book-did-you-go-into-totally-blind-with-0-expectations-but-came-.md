<div>Update: wow thank you everyone for sharing your books! It gives me a &quotsonder&quot moment, to think about all of us sharing that feeling with different titles and in different times and places ❣️</div>

<div>I just finished Bury Your Gays by Chuck Tingle. I had only read his short erotica comedy stuff and got the book when he came to my town on a tour. I finally got around to reading it and just had so much fun! It felt very personal/vulnerable, mysterious, unique, and all around just an awesome easyread book that touched on a lot of topics (it's about an LA horror script writer who begins having some strange horrific stuff happen to him, while also dealing with his childhood closeted trauma/coming out).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe it liked it so much because I had ZERO thoughts about it or expectations so it could only go up! But wondering if any other people have had that experience and if so what book did it for you. I honestly was blown away by how much I liked this book, and the audiobook version too. </div>
