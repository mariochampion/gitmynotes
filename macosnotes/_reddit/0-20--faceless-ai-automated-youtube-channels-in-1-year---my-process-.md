<div>First of all before diving deep into this process (scroll a bit below) I have to say something that everyone keeps asking me, is it profitable?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Yes. It's by far my most profitable venture outside of my regular 9-5... But it took a lot of work, delegation and building processes to get here. So the one thing I would love to get out of this post - if you have any insights, feedback or tools I might be missing out post them below and let's help each other out.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Now, how you can get started with (AI) YouTube automation:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>**Pick a topic that is BOTH:**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>a) in demand  </div>
<div>b) interesting to you &ampamp; you have knowledge about</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>**Do everything yourself at first - delegate later**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>No one cares about the videos as much as you do, so make sure to nail the ideation, scripts, editing, format and packaging yourself first.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>**Now that we got that out of the way:**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>**Use this workflow:**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>VidIQ - outliers sections is pure gold, I use it all the time to find trending video packaging, topics, etc.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>ChatGPT or Claude - high level video ideas at scale and your assistant (I use projects inside ChatGPT and its really good at managing and prioritizing). If you are using it for scripts please for the love of god, make final edits yourself by hand. Add character, personal insights, ideas, etc.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Katalist AI - all in one video generator tool I use to quickly go from video idea to script, storyboard, AI voiceover and then final visuals. It's surprisingly good and to make a decent video it only takes about 1-2 hours in TOTAL. Once you understand how it works and have a process, delegate to tech savvy VAs / content creators for $5-$15/hour and you have final, good quality videos for less than $30.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Pikzels / Krea AI - your AI thumbnail generator, I dont remember the last time we used Photoshop outside of quick text or image edits. Its basically AI image manipulation at scale and it costs 10-30x less than a human thumbnail designer and the thumbnails are really good.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>VidIQ+TubeBuddy - titles &ampamp; optimization, but you have to know that most of the views come usually from recommended, so dont over obsess and add 392x keywords in your title and description. Its all about the packaging.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>Now whats left is track performance &ampamp; iterate - it's practically impossible to nail it the first few times, but each video you make look at the data (not just in YT studio) and UNDERSTAND why it did not perform as well as you thought it would.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>Regarding monetization, adsense sucks - sell digital products. If I was relying on adsense alone I would never ever be profitable, but selling mini digital products and mentioning CTAs in the actual video not just in the description makes this super profitable and scaleable, especially since video production is so cheap.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>Final thoughts:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>(AI) YouTube automation absolutely works, but it’s not an overnight success or a total hands-off cashcow machine. It’s a real business and you need systems, consistent effort, iteration, failing and learning along the way.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you’ve got any tips, hidden gems or tools I might be missing, drop them below &ampamp; let’s help each other out.</div>
