<div>Source: This is the field I work in professionally. I am happy to provide bonfides to the Mods if asked. I've been writing these snippets for friends, found this community and thought it might be welcome. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Today's digital privacy snippet - how to opt-out of a chunk of giant ad tracking databases in less than 15 minutes. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This is one of a handful of relatively easy steps even the least tech-comfortable person can do to start making themselves harder to find. This is nowhere near everything, I've been trying to break the pieces into actions that can be completed quickly without writing a giant novel. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>There are two major organizations (NAI/DAA) that many advertising companies belong to, and they have a pair of mass opt-out sites you can use to tell every company in their networks to get their digital noses out of your backside. I've been doing this awhile, and WOW the ads get weird, but that's also proof they can't find 'you', so it's working.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Opting out of this [targeted/profiling](https://thenai.org/about-online-advertising/) advertising hamstrings shenanigans like discriminatory ads, and is a step in protecting your profiles from being used for malicious reasons.  For example, apartment listings set to not show for Black people can only successfully hide if the ad-server can identify your race.*</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>On to real actions...</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>[Opt Out One](https://optout.networkadvertising.org)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>For the first link, you want to select 'Manage my Browser Opt-outs', then select all. You might need a couple rounds, they didn't all save successfully when I first tried. (If you get 403: Forbidden, that's your VPN, you may have to pause it temporarily to complete these steps.) More companies join over time, so I do this 2x/mo now for upkeep. If a handful fail after a couple tries, let it go and come back in a few days. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>[Email Opt Out - Audience Matching Advertising](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/optout/email)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Then come back, and go to this second link to opt your email address(es) out of the same. You'll have to go to each email address and confirm it's yours to finish this step.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>[Second Network Optout](https://optout.aboutads.info)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>For round 3, the link above goes to the second advertiser network (DAA), and their opt-out options. Many companies belong to both networks, so you'll likely find some here already listed as opt-out from step #1 above.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>For optional round 3.5, look for an app called 'App Choices'. It does the same thing for ads you receive through phone apps. The app also lets you exercise your rights under the CCPA to block sale of all of your personal data. Technically that law is for CA residents, but it let me opt-out anyway. Fines under that law are punitive enough that CA sometimes protects the rest of us by proxy. I have it running, but don't have a lot of apps that show ads, so I can't verify how well it's working yet.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Limits:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>1. This doesn't stop spam emails.This is a voluntary industry standard that legit companies have agreed to use. Not all companies belong to these networks, but as someone who works with this data, I can attest you're covering a huge number of the big players. </div>
<div>2. This doesn't stop transactional emails, or anything you specifically signed up to receive. Gotta unsub those yourself.</div>
<div>3. This doesn't stop advertising in general, but it does slow down Big Data's ability to create targeted profiles of 'you' to manipulate. Ad-blockers are also a useful layer but also break a lot of websites. </div>
<div>4. This opt-out is specific to the browser/device you run it on, so if you have a laptop and phone, make sure to do this from both. If you have to completely clear your browser cache/cookies for troubleshooting, come back and set these again also.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>*How this data can be used both intentionally and accidentally for evil. https://verfassungsblog.de/targeted-ad/</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>** Also, this makes it harder for maliciously targeted ads, like 'Here's a fake AI rage-bait video perfectly crafted to go viral. Release it to enrage &amplt;opposing political group&ampgt; on Tuesday so they're too distracted to notice something else we're pulling.'</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>~~If there's interest in more of this, I've got 3-4 other ones I've written for friends that I can post too.~~</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Alrighty, I'll clean up my others and post over the next couple days. Thanks all, great questions!</div>
