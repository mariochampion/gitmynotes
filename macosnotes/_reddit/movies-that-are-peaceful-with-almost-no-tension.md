<div>Hello</div>
<div>I'm pretty stressed lately and I'm looking for movies that are, in all aspects, calm and peaceful. It's okay if its a little sad or bittersweet or even funnyâ€”but I'm looking for something with almost no tension.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Most movies, even really calm ones like howl's moving castle, have an act with a lot of tension and fighting, i'm looking for a movie without that. The first examples I come up with are where is marnie, which has beautiful scenery but is essentially devoided of big tension actsâ€”and it's still great. Another example is lady bird, which even though had some tension with the mom plot, is pretty easy and not stressful to watch. For a show counterpart i'd say adventure time, midnight ghospel, gumball or hilda, since they are mostly quacky adventures that get resolved easily (I've watched those like a 100times though so thats why im looking now xD)</div>
<div>If you have ideas for series/shows too im up to it!</div>
<div>I hope yall have some good ideas! Have a beautiful day everyone!</div>

<div>Edit: Wow so many answers! I didnt expect it im so thankful for all I've received so far but I might not be able to answer to everything ðŸ˜…. I'll watch them over the next few days. Thanks again!</div>
