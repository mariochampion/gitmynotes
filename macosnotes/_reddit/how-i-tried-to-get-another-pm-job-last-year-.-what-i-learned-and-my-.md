<div><h1>How I tried to get another PM job last year . What I learned and my overall experience hiring someone to apply for jobs for me</h1></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>Context: Product Manager with 3 years work experience at a third world county, working at healthcare, severely underpaid and not technical.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I first reached out to the guy that postes [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/12fsxxy/thoughts_on_job_application_service_oe_friendly/) but he didn’t answer right away so I ended up filling the form in one of his comments and then he called me via phone. He gave me an overview of the service and we then scheduled a video call to go over the specifics and how the process works. He offered me a 1500 package with no guarantee and a 3k one with guarantee so I picked that.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>What really got me interested was the way the guy presented the system, it was all built with good practices in place and looked like it would work way better than everything else being sold to me, I tried a few of those ai auto application software's free trials but never got anything from them.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>He then prepared 2 new CVs for me, based on my experience writing code as a SWE analyst he tailored my CV for different software jobs verticals.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Got explained the process and what to expect, made me create a new Gmail account, share LinkedIn access with him and be ready for the applications to start rolling in. He explained that the Gmail account was so that any interview that came via that new email to be attributed to his efforts and things not to get messed up.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I was surprised when the applications started rolling in (about 30-40 a day), not only that he sent personalized messages to each recruiter on the jobs, and sometimes even 2 people in the company. Somehow even managed to get people’s emails and also reached out via email to increase the % likelihood of me getting called for an interview.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>After the second week I got my first interview invitation (most often than not just got rejections), the Overemployer guy called me straight away and told me to record the call so we could review later, I did horribly on that interview but he explained how to improve, things to have in mind and that the most important goal on each interview is moving to the next. More interviews rolled in following the next 2 weeks. I got about 6 interviews total from 500 applications that were made. He told me it was under average, but probably because entry level SWE are very hard to get these days as we are in a recession. I ended up getting a very low offer from this staffing agency that placed me on a random not even tech company but that needed a programmer that could wear all hats, it’s been 2 weeks and so far I haven't’ gotten any crazy training and the requirements are pretty low. Looks like will be a good place to be long term. About my first job I’ll just keep it until I get fired, don’t really care anymore but after reading some posts on here it makes sense to make the extra money and save as much as I can.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Finally, I landed a low offer from a staffing agency—not exactly a dream tech job, but they needed a programmer who could handle multiple things. So far, no intense training, the requirements are light, and it seems like a good place to stick around. As for my old job, I’m just keeping it until they kick me out—might as well make some extra cash.</div>
