<div><h1>How I Make Meta Ads Work for My Art-Photography Business</h1></div>
<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>I thought I’d share some insights into Meta advertising and how I’ve made it work for my art-photography business. My experience seems to run counter to much of the advice I’ve seen about marketing art online, so hopefully, this helps someone out there.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>To give you some context:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>• I have an Instagram page, but I don’t focus on engagement or seek followers.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>• My audience connects with my work, not me as an artist.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>• I don’t sell in person—all of my sales are online, to people I’ve never met.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>• I’ve built a business with around $300K in print sales annually.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The key to my success has been *highly targeted audience selection* and *leveraging data effectively*. I also use Reddit to promote my work—it’s my most successful platform outside of paid advertising.</div>
<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>**Audience Targeting**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I took inspiration from a seller of golf clubs who shared this tip: *Don’t target Tiger Woods fans.* While Tiger Woods has a huge following, many of his fans aren’t golfers—they’re casual fans of the sport. Instead, they recommended targeting 4th or 5th-ranked PGA players, the ones only true golf enthusiasts would know. (this was in a podcast, I'm afraid I can't remember which!)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I applied this principle to my photography, which is focused on classical music. Rather than targeting broad categories like “violins” or famous musicians like Yo-Yo Ma or 2Cellos, I target people who both play an instrument, and who follow lesser-known but beloved artists like Janine Jansen, Truls Mørk, or Martha Argerich. These are names that only people deeply invested in classical music would know.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This strategy works well if your art has a specific theme or subject—find those niche interests and target accordingly.</div>
<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>**Using Data Effectively**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Meta ads require a lot of data to perform well. For example, the platform’s AI needs around 50 conversions (typically purchases) in two weeks to exit the “learning phase.” That’s a tall order, especially for new advertisers.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>To make it work, I set my conversion event to “add-to-cart” instead of “purchase.” This trains the algorithm faster and captures potential buyers who may convert later (sometimes weeks or months down the line).</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I start with a budget I can afford to lose. Once I see a return of over 2.5x ROAS (return on ad spend), I begin scaling up. For reference, my breakeven point is a 2.0 ROAS, but this number will depend on your costs. Over the last few months leading up to Christmas, I scaled my daily spend to around $500 USD.</div>
<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>**Ad Strategy**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I typically run two types of ad sets:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>1. **Cold Targeting**: This is where I use the niche audience targeting described above. I use carousel ads to show multiple full images of my work or videos with zoom effects. I don't show any mockups at this point.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>2. **Retargeting**: I retarget people who’ve already visited my website. For these ads, I use mockups of my work framed and displayed in rooms to help them visualize how it looks in their space.</div>
<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>**Using Reddit**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If your work has a theme, there’s likely a subreddit for it (or multiple). I post in subreddits about classical music, photography, and similar niches, always respecting the rules. Some subs don’t allow links or watermarks, but that’s okay—if someone is interested, they’ll ask for details in the comments.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>A well-received post can get bumped to the Popular page, which is where reporters often look for stories. This has landed my work in almost every major European newspaper, with around 20 million reproductions in print over the last two years. That’s advertising I could never afford to pay for!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Having a cohesive set of themed images helps enormously, as it gives people something to write about.</div>
<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>**Final Tips**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>• Don't mess with an ad in the first three days. Meta takes time to find your audience, and the audience usually needs at least a few days to comit to a purchase, especially for large expensive prints.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div> • If an ad isn’t performing after about 7 days, turn it off and try something new. Don’t fall into the sunk cost fallacy—it’s real and can hurt!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This approach won’t work for everyone, but I hope it’s helpful for those of you trying to market your art online. Let me know if you have any questions or experiences to share!</div>
