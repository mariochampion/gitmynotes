<div>These are the only apps you need. Really</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>1. Start with notes. If you need to add this note to reminders just use the tag #RemindMe in that note.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>2. Copy these two shortcuts:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The First shortcut Adds any note with #RemindMe tag to Reminders. It also adds a url (not deep link) to a second shortcut that then opens the associated note from reminders. It also adds a “processed” marker to a note that has already been added to reminders to avoid duplication.</div>
<div>The second shortcut just opens the note when url is clicked from reminders.</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>3. Now that scheduled reminders show by default in calendar, that is all you need</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>4. I use Apple Notes because it is the ONLY APP that I have seen that embeds a video in a note which can be watched from the note itself. These default apps are really all you need.</div>
