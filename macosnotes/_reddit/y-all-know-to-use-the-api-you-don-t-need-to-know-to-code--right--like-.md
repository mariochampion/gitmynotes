<div>Complaint: Using Claude API 2024-12-15 11:34:16 CST</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I am wondering if people think you need to know how to code to use the API. You don't.   </div>
<div>  </div>
<div>You won't have all the bells and whistles but you can still use Claude for most things you were before with just copy and paste it into the convo (images, text files, etc).</div>

<div>If all you need is a quick fix or to talk about other details while the web browser is on cool down, this is a great alternative. </div>
