<div>Hey, everyone! </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I have recently purchased a MacBook M4. It is the first apple product I have ever owned and so far, it seems okay. But I need your help to make it better.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I have been using Ubuntu as my main platform since 2013. Over time I have become a power user on Debian Linux distros. And I miss all the open source apps. I am hoping there are some open source projects on GitHub that can give some of the control I had over my system.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This brings me to my question. What open source tools have been truly useful to you? Which ones give you the most control over your machine?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I have found some the following apps on GitHub, but as I do not know the Mac world so well I am unsure what else to look for.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>- Quick recorder: https://github.com/lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder</div>
<div>- Power monitor: https://github.com/SAP/power-monitoring-tool-for-macos</div>
<div>- Some more from brew...</div>
