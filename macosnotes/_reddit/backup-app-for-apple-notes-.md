<div>How can we incentivize someone to build an app to backup apple notes?  Ive tried all organizing apps and the recent changes of the app and the way it works in the apple ecosystem make it the best for me.  I have so many great notes with multiple pdfs included hand written notes, tags etc. If i lost them id be sick for a long time.</div>

<div>You can share the notes in emails and then download the attachments but that takes a lot of time and if you wanted to recover your files exactly it would take some rework. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This would be a useful app to build.   I hope apple addresses this. Ive seen some solutions in this sub red but are there any solutions that are reliable and would allow you to restore backed up notes back into the app?</div>
