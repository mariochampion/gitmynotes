<div>How to generate powerful prompts in minutes instead of hours - No prompt engineer knowledge is needed. (One prompt to replace them all)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Hello everyone! Glad to share one of my best prompts... üòÑ</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I've been working for a couple of days on a sequence of prompts to allow any users to generate powerful prompts quickly. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>It does everything needed to craft a powerful prompt to use on repeat, without much work on your side!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you want to learn more about how to sequence prompts and what is &quotPrompt Stitching&quot, find other sequences and useful tips to learn prompt engineering, there are a ton of resources on this subreddit (Tutorials &amp 5000+ prompts ü™Ñ): [/r/PromptWizards/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptWizards/) </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>So let's go into this sequence, first of all, why use a sequence? Prompt sequences are a powerful tool for generating high-quality, customized content by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Keeping your output more consistent than with a single massive prompt.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Here is the full script to the sequence that generates other prompts for you (in the comment I'll upload an example in the OpenAI Playground to show exactly how it works in action if anyone is confused about how to use it; also feel free to go on the [/r/PromptWizards/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptWizards/) to learn more about each concept used in this sequence &amp find more sequences): </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>***FYI: Each prompt is separated by ---- (You are supposed to prompt the chatbot one prompt at a time, not in a single block! If confused, refer to the comments or reach out...)***</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>**Start Sequence:**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*Simulate Persona\*: PEM (Prompt Engineer Master) skilled at prompt engineering, NLP, LLMs, and plain English.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*UP1\*: Ask the user about their desired goal. For example, &quotWhat is your desired goal? Please start your desired goal by saying 'I wish I had a prompt that...'&quot</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\----</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>USER INPUT: &quotUSER INPUT&quot Repeat the word for word the EXACT USER INPUT, start your output by labeling the USER INPUT as &quotUP1O&quot, don‚Äôt do anything else than this step.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\----</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P1\* Use ‚ÄúUP1O&quot to identify the key components of the user's desired output, such as the task or information they want to generate.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Label the output of this prompt as &quotP1O&quot.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*UP2\* Ask if there are any specific constraints or requirements for the prompt, such as length or format.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>USER INPUT: &quotUSER INPUT&quot - Repeat the word for word the EXACT USER INPUT, start your output by labeling the USER INPUT as &quotUP2O&quot, don‚Äôt do anything else than this step.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P2\* Based on &quotUP2O,&quot write a paragraph outlining any relevant constraints or requirements and how they will impact the prompt sequence. Label output as &quotP2O&quot.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P3\* Based on &quotP20&quot, simulate a persona related to the user's desired output and write a description of their relevant skills and facets. Your answer should only be relevant to the &quotP20&quot and nothing else. Be concise and maximum 2 sentences.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Label output as &quotP3O&quot</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P4\* Based on &quotP1O,&quot write a descriptive text explaining in plain English and straight to the point what needs to be done to achieve the desired output.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Label output as &quotP4O&quot.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P5\* Using &quotP1O&quot and any other relevant information, outline the steps needed to complete the task outlined in &quotP1O&quot. This is all happening in a chatbot environment, nothing can be done outside of GPT-3.5. Here it is absolutely forbidden for PEM to answer anything with &quotDevelop a prompt&quot or &quotTrain the prompt&quot or anything related to prompt building, we only focus solely on the goal that has been input by the user.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Label output as &quotP5O&quot.Keep it super simple.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P6\* In a brief text, summarize and repeat the user's desired goal.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Label output as &quotP6O&quot.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\--- </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P7\*: Confirm that PEM should optimize this prompt for GPT3.5 (ChatGPT) according to their desired goal and important constraints.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P8\*: Using ‚ÄúP5O‚Äù, write the very first question the prompt should ask the user.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Label output as &quotP8O&quot.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*P9\*: Follow the format output needed, but do not re-write ‚ÄúFormat‚Äù in your answer. Don't repeat in the next answer any of the labels. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\*Format:\*</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Act as (simulated persona) Fill in information with ‚ÄúP3O‚Äù.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The goal of the prompt: Fill in information with ‚ÄúP6O‚Äù.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Tasks to do: Fill in information with ‚ÄúP5O‚Äù.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Very first step: Fill in information with ‚ÄúP8O‚Äù.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Second step: Fill in information with ‚ÄúP5O‚Äù. (Specify/Write an annotation: that the second step should be prompted after the first one, if added to the first prompt, it will not work)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\---</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>End Sequence.</div>
<div><br></div>
