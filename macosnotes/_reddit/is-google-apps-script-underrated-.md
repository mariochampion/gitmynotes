<div><h1>Is Google Apps Script Underrated?</h1></div>

<div>I’ve been using Google Apps Script for a while now, and I’m honestly surprised it doesn’t get more attention—especially with all the AI and automation hype going on right now.  </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>It’s free, super accessible (built right into Google Workspace), and incredibly simple to use, even if you’re not a hardcore developer. You can automate tasks, integrate APIs, and build powerful workflows without setting up servers or dealing with complex infrastructure.  </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I know tools like Make and Zapier are popular because they’re no-code, but in my experience, there are so many cases where it’s actually *simpler* to just use Google Apps Script—especially when you need to refine the logic behind a data sync or automation. Sometimes those drag-and-drop platforms feel more limiting or even overly complex for what should be a straightforward script.  </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Yet, I don’t hear nearly as much hype about Apps Script compared to other automation tools. Why do you think that is? Do people just not know about it, or is there something holding it back from wider adoption?</div>
