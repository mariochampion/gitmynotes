<div>U.S. job openings fell to the lowest in September in over three years. However, while the unemployment rate has been low, the number of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment has risen. If you’re one of those people hit by layoffs who can't find a job, it can be daunting. Not only is job searching a time-consuming process, but it can also hit you hard financially. To stay afloat, many job seekers have even resorted to making withdrawals from their retirement accounts. According to investment management company Vanguard, 3.6% of participants initiated a hardship withdrawal in 2023, up from 2.8% in 2022. For people facing financial stress, hardship withdrawals often serve as a much-needed safety net.</div>
