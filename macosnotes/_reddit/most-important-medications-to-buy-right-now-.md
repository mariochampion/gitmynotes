<div>I’ve got some extra savings and was going to buy some medical items while I can. I’m getting some plan b pills, along with some masks and gloves. I’m already stocked on basic medications like aspirin &ampamp; cold meds. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Just wondering what y’all would mostly focus on stocking up on right now now considering all things in America. </div>

<div>Thanks!!</div>
