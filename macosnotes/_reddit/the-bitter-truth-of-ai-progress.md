<div>I read The bitter lesson by Rich Sutton recently which talks about it. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Summary: </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Rich Sutton’s essay The Bitter Lesson explains that over 70 years of AI research, methods that leverage massive computation have consistently outperformed approaches relying on human-designed knowledge. This is largely due to the exponential decrease in computation costs, enabling scalable techniques like search and learning to dominate. While embedding human knowledge into AI can yield short-term success, it often leads to methods that plateau and become obstacles to progress. Historical examples, including chess, Go, speech recognition, and computer vision, demonstrate how general-purpose, computation-driven methods have surpassed handcrafted systems. Sutton argues that AI development should focus on scalable techniques that allow systems to discover and learn independently, rather than encoding human knowledge directly. This “bitter lesson” challenges deeply held beliefs about modeling intelligence but highlights the necessity of embracing scalable, computation-driven approaches for long-term success.</div>
