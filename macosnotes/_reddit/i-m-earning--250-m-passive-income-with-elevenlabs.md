<div>I remember seeing a post here a while back about using ElevenLabs to create an AI clone of your own voice. I thought it sounded intriguing, so I decided to give it a try— the results have been pretty ok. After just one day of setup, it’s already generating a bit of income on its own. How I did it:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>**My Setup Process:**  </div>
<div>To start, I dedicated an afternoon to recording audio of myself reading a books, then uploaded it all to their platform. If you give it a go, make sure you pick the “Professional Voice Clone” option rather than the “Instant Voice Clone.” You’ll need at least 30 minutes of clear audio (more is always better), and it’s good to use a quality microphone in a quiet space.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>**The Processing Step:**  </div>
<div>After submitting my recordings, it was pretty hands-off. I named my voice, wrote up a quick description, and added my payment details. Within about 4 hours, my AI voice was live in their library. I haven’t touched it since, and I’m earning money whenever people choose to use my voice.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>**My Earnings So Far:**  </div>
<div>It’s now been exactly one month since I set this up, and I’ve earned EUR 238 (about USD 249). They pay weekly through Stripe, which is convenient.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>**Subscription Details:**  </div>
<div>There is a catch: you need to be on their Creator tier, which costs $22/month, to earn money from your voice. But for me, it’s already paid off more than the cost of the subscription.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Don’t worry if your voice isn’t the classic “radio voice.” Maybe you have a unique accent or want to try a character style—go for it! My voice is fairly ordinary, with a slight Polish accent, and it seems to be working in my favor.</div>
