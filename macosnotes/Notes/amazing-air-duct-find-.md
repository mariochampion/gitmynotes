<div>Amazing air duct find!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Bought our house last year from the original owners, built 1956. Old AC unit was busted so we had it replaced. After the installation I was looking at the ductwork in the basement and saw some papers resting on top. I grabbed the step ladder thinking it was paperwork for the new AC the HVAC guy left up there and pull down a couple of old nudie mags (not pictured). I do a thorough search of the rest of the ducts and find two plastic bread bags filled with silver coins! 253 coins total including 6 Morgan's, a bunch of Benjamin's and walking liberty's, and around 40 1964 Kennedy half dollars. I've been high on this find for weeks!</div>

<div>Note: First picture is a little pirate chest I put them in for my son to find when he's older.</div>
