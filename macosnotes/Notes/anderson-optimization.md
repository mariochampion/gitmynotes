<div><b>Based on your research into Anderson Optimization tell us why you're interested in being a part of our growing company.</b><br></div>
<div>Renewables are fundamental for a viable climate future, to address and in some ways capitalize on the new normal of heat domes, and to stabilize and ideally supplant the fragile power grids (like the one in Texas where I live), and more. We have to understand the lay of the land (our energy present) to make the best decisions for our genuinely shared paths forward to our energy future. From my initial readings, Anderson Optimization is building tools to quickly and efficiently adjudicate the value of many of the points on these paths. And that sounds like a great opportunity to help something build innovative and useful.<br></div>

<div><b>Briefly, what have you learned by working with software engineering teams?</b><br></div>
<div>I am deeply experienced both in technical development and writing user stories and tickets for creative and thoughtful engineers. Having spent years of my previous life writing python, sql, js, (heck, even php), APIs, ci/cd processes, AI/ML libraries, AWS cloud tools, and more, I understand the critical need for product and tech specs which speak the right language at the right time, balancing clarity of desired outcomes, experiences, and aggregate capabilities without prescribing “recipes” for capable software engineers.<br></div>
