<div>The deeply religious West Texas fracking billionaires Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks began their scorched-earth political conquest of Texas about 20 years ago with one of their key goals being the replacement of public education with publicly-funded private Christian schools.</div>

<div>Texas Monthly - The Campaign to Sabotage Texas’s Public Schools</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>“But by far the most powerful opponents of public schools in the state are West Texas oil billionaires Tim Dunn and the brothers Farris and Dan Wilks. Their vast political donations have made them the de facto owners of many Republican members of the Texas Legislature.”</div>

<div>Texas Monthly - The Billionaire Bully Who Wants to Turn Texas Into a Christian Theocracy (Article)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>“The state’s most powerful figure, Tim Dunn, isn’t an elected official. But behind the scenes, the West Texas oilman is lavishly financing what he regards as a holy war against public education, renewable energy, and non-Christians.”</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>“The goal is to tear up, tear down public education to nothing and rebuild it,” Dororthy Burton, a former GOP activist who joined Wilks on a 2015 speaking tour, told CNN. “And rebuild it the way God intended education to be.”</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>“People who’ve worked with Wilks and Dunn say they share an ultimate goal: replacing much of public education in Texas with private Christian schools. Now, educators and students are feeling the impact of that conservative ideology on the state’s school system.”</div>

<div>CNN - How two Texas megadonors have turbocharged the state’s far-right shift</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>“Critics, and even some former associates, say that Dunn and Wilks demand loyalty from the candidates they back, punishing even deeply conservative legislators who cross them by bankrolling primary challengers.”</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>“And NBC News reports that the ‘school choice’ push has been funded in large part by ‘a Christian nationalist-aligned political action committee … bankrolled by a pair of West Texas billionaires,’ Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks, who ‘have expressed the view that Texas state government should be guided by Biblical values and run exclusively by evangelical Christians.’”</div>

<div>Former Texas State Senator Kel Seliger (R-Midland):</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>“It is a Russian-style oligarchy, pure and simple. Really, really wealthy people who are willing to spend a lot of money to get policy made the way they want it, and they get it.”</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>“That’s the law of the jungle now in Texas and that’s why a lot of Republican House members, the majority of Republican Senate members just, they dance to whatever tune Tim Dunn wants to play.”</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>“One man who stood up to them is State Sen. Kel Seliger, a Republican who is retiring this year. Though a staunch conservative who has voted with most of the far-right policies pushed by Dunn and the Wilkses, he balked at some of their attempts to attack public schools and drive funding to faith based private ones. Ever since, he has been targeted by their money for replacement.”</div>

<div>“History will prove that our current state government is the most corrupt ever and is ‘bought’ by a few radical dominionist billionaires seeking to destroy public education, privatize our public schools and create a Theocracy that is both un-American and un-Texan.”</div>
