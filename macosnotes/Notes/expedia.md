<div>When I was hired, Liquibase, a “devops for the database” solution, only offered an open-source project and a fairly expensive Enterprise offering.

In this time, I have also PM'ed the Enterprise product, the recently sunset Liquibase Hub experiment, and the extensions and testing-focused Interop team.</div>
