<div>It rained and it rained and it rained but then the sun came out. And you could see Jebadius Springfield on his daily stroll. This was his post nap stroll when before he was awoken very rudely by his Pet snapping turtle. Chonky boy the snapping turtle was oddly insistent on his second breakfast of fruit loops. He made a sound like HAJEJWHFBFJWEHFJDHF Since he had not had a “full breakfast”. Jebadius Springfield arouse from his bed to trip over Chonky Boy’s abnormally large head and fell dramatically into a pile of dirty laundry which Chonky Boy had most recently used as the toilet. Of course Jebadius Springfield HAD to fall into again dramatically. After proceeding with much discussion he gave Chonky Boy his desired fruit loops and went on his post napping walk.<br></div>

<div>As combination PM, technical PM, and PO, I spend time along the entire product spectrum from customer calls and demos, hosting and participating in multiple cross-departmental customer-centered chats, meet and demo with users, customer success, sales engineers, engineering, QA, marketing, sales. On the more tactical side, I co-create roadmaps, write epics, user stories, Reqs and AC, backlog grooming, standups, retros, as well as wrangle and perform UAT. Additionally, I draft release notes, manage releases, and create narratives for blogs and email newsletters. I have also crafted instructional videos for youtube and Liquibase University. Tool wise, I spend a lot of time in Jira, Confluence, Trello, Google suite, Miro, AIO reports, Github, Docker, AWS, Slack, CI/CD and DevOps, and in the terminal/command-line with python testing the product itself.<br></div>
