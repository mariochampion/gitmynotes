<div>Is it just me, or is Ko-Fi a bit underrated?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I see a lot of posts on Threads from artists lately trying to figure out if Etsy is still worth it and what alternatives are out there. I've decided to try Ko-Fi as I start out my business.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>KoFi really seems to have it all; tips, donations, monthly memberships, storefront, gallery, post feed... heck, it's even basically a link tree type site, as you can link to all your other stuff. Short of them starting up a Threads-like Social Media stream, it's an all-in-one site really. I think it seems like a great option for those starting out and/or those not able to set up Shopify (or other e-commerce) and a personal website.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Regardless, it seems like it's much less well known and underutilised... I can see the downside being only Pay Pal or Stripe as payment set up options. Or of course, if you don't pay for Gold, there is a flat platform fee of 5%. Still, that's a lot less fees than Etsy and as I understand it, less than Patreon too. Also, they aren't advertising for you... But still.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I feel like I'm going to be using a best kept secret  for artists platform or something. ðŸ˜‚ Surely there must be a reason more people aren't using it? Is it simply just not as well known? I feel like my biggest concern atm is people not signing up for my membership tiers, because they don't know/trust/aren't signed up to Ko-Fi already, unlike big, well known co Patreon.</div>
