<div><h1>helene prep supply themes</h1></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>So, I’ve just lived through the hell named Helene. I want to prepare for weather and economic hard times. Here’s what I learned I need to prep for (and what I did right).</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>1.	⁠A week of food is not enough. 2 is better. I’m aiming for a month (at least) after Helene. Make sure it’s food you like, is simple to prepare (if you don’t have chickens, don’t buy mixes that need eggs unless you have freeze dried eggs, etc), and rotate the food into your normal year and replace when you do so it doesn’t go stale. Don’t forget pet food.</div>
<div>2.	⁠At LEAST a week of drinking water. 2 is better. Have a plan for flushing. I used a garden cart under a downspout and never had lack of water for flushing. Just filled a watering can to fill the toilet tank as needed.</div>
<div>3.	⁠Sanitizer. Hand, surface wipes, and bleach. If water is scarce, you still need to be clean and safe. Again, rotate in and out of regular use.</div>
<div>4.	⁠Chainsaw and fuel. Trees prevent travel and you can’t tarp your roof easily with a tree on it.</div>
<div>5.	⁠Tarps and bungees. Cheap is fine.</div>
<div>6.	⁠Generator (small), fuel, and extension cords. Plan for bare minimum usage and purchase size, fuel, and cords accordingly.</div>
<div>7.	⁠Solar charger for phone/medical devices.</div>
<div>8.	⁠Garden. At least small containers. You’d be surprised at how helpful fresh herbs are for canned food and your mood about eating it.</div>
<div>9.	⁠Camp stove or your choice of off grid cooking, and fuel. I prefer the ease and stability of my Coleman stove/fuel, but if you have a gas grill, get an extra propane tank or two that are always full.</div>
<div>10.	⁠Tool box. Cordless and hand tools, always have charged batteries for the cordless. Include storage for tools OFF THE FLOOR AND LOW SHELVES. If you experience flooding in basement/garage/tool storage areas they need to be dry. Especially lithium batteries, they can cause fires if drowned. Add a box of clips, clamps, fasteners for tarp/plastic sheeting.</div>
<div>11.	⁠Lights. Flashlights for each door and bedroom with plenty of batteries.</div>
<div>12.	⁠Strategy. Storage of tools, food, and supplies out of home flood-zones. Keep vital records in a ziplock baggies, together. Plan your purchases. Stick to a budget. Have a rainy day fund. Keep at least 2 weeks of meds on hand…this includes prescription formula if your baby needs it. Put at least 10% of your paycheck away for retirement…tithe to future-you before anything else. Designate a single point of contact outside your weather region to give/receive updates. Know where your utility shutoffs are and label them. Have emergency #s on a paper list with your vital records.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>That’s what I prep for/learned. Helene was a huge wake-up that I was both more ready than I thought, and needed to prioritize some updates that felt like “wants” more than “needs” before someday became oh-sh*t-it’s-someday-NOW.</div>
