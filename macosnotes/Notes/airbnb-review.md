<div>We stayed in Isabella and Marcos’ place for 4 weeks, and it is a great place to stay in a great part of an awesome city. There are literally dozens of places for meals, fruit, coffee, treats and actual groceries with a few minutes walk. And a great bookstore/cafe across the street. And the beautiful Avenida Amsterdam probably 100 meters away, And an ecobici/bike rental literally steps away (a great quick, cheap, and eco-friendly way to get or Chapultepec or other places beyond the 10-15 min walking radius.) And, And, And… it is a great location! <br></div>

<div>Isabella was super responsive and friendly when we had a few questions. It might feel weird to have an elevator direct to your apt, but it only works by key, and so even when a maintenance engineer had to come up for 5 mins to look at something, we had to go down to the lobby to get him. So it really is secure. All the windows open to provide great cross-ventilation, and when closed reduce like 95% of the streetscape sounds. This is a big modern city, so there are city noises, but not enough to to be concerned about or keep us awake, at least for us. The doormen were also always helpful and friendly, so one more level of security if you have that concern at all.<br></div>

<div>Overall, a great choice I am glad we made. Thanks Isabella for being an excellent airbnb host!<br></div>

<div>Hey Isabella, thanks for being a great airbnb host! Just the right hands-on/ hands-off touch for us. Overall almost everything was awesome, but I have a couple of small suggestions that I think would take a few minutes and/or just a few pesos.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>One small thing would be to tighten a bunch of hinges on the cabinets. as a homeowner myself I know these just get loose over time, and for the lower ones I bet people put their weight on them as they get pots and pans etc. Some are flexing/moving in a way that will break over time. So just in case you dont actually stay there and wouldnt have noticed this.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Also, it'd be nice to get even a cheap set of cookware with lids. We actually bought and left a saucepan and a silicon spatula. There was only a small and large skillet, and non-flexible spatulas which make cooking less than ideal. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Small suggestions I hope, but for long term stayers who made 75% of breakfasts and probably 50% of dinners at home, it would be useful!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Thanks for hosting!<br></div>
