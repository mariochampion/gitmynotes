<div><b>We're a small team focused on building world-class data services and research solutions that companies use to generate high-value insights for their businesses. </b><br></div>
<div>We’re a bootstrapped, profitably growing, super scrappy startup hell-bent on shaking up the consumer data and market research industries. Every day, we strive to increase the availability of data, reduce friction in its analysis, and ultimately level the data playing field; we're on an audacious mission to lower the barriers to data-driven insights.</div>
<div>We work hard at being productive both as individuals and as a team. We hire relentless, resourceful, and resilient people and let them do their thing. Everyone's role is pivotal to the company so each team member's perspective matters deeply.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><u>If you join DDMR, you will be making a significant impact from day one.</u><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>And you'll continue to grow, too. We are committed to developing our people into the best versions of themselves. We pride ourselves not just in what we've produced, but also in how much each of our team members and alumni has gone on to accomplish.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We're still a young business, so you'll be a significant contributor to the evolving processes and culture that make DDMR great. You’ll be involved cross-functionally, interfacing with engineering, product, and marketing. And each and every team member works directly with our serial-entrepreneur CEO on mapping out our strategy.</div>
