<div>I admittedly haven't watched them yet, but university extension services are the best for food preservation tips. A lot of things on Pinterest or elsewhere can get you sick. Even if you don't have the time or supplies for canning or dehydrating, I'd highly recommend looking into tips for freezing things and having them still taste good. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>During the pandemic, I had the disappointment of finding that homemade chicken soup I made and ladled into glass Mason jars shattered the jar after being put in the freezer, even though I cooled in in the fridge first. It was a bummer. I switched to cheap deli quart containers so it's easy to share food with others (i.e. you're sick! Have some homemade chicken soup!) Or to throw away containers that have been forgotten about.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I had some other foods get frost burn or change texture in yucky ways. I had a couple of things I had to throw away because I forgot to put a date on them. And I've learned to freeze things in small quantities because I have a small family. Big props to the homesteading ladies with big families, but their recipes are a bit much for me!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I also learned how to vacuum seal and organize frozen foods.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The other preservation method to keep in mind if you don't have much equipment is quick pickling in the fridge. The food doesn't actually ferment if you are afraid of germs or mold- you soak it in a mixture of vinegar, salt and spices in the fridge, and the food soaks up the flavor. I was given a grocery bag containing a large number of banana peppers this summer, and I don't think I would ever eat a pile of banana peppers by themselves. But I quick pickled them in my fridge and had something to make boring sandwiches more tasty.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>You don't need fancy or expensive jars for fridge pickles. A friend of mine actually washes out sauce jars from the grocery store for hers. She calls them her &quotkimchi jars&quot. This is because fridge pickles don't require perfectly sealing the lid- the fridge keeps the food safe. Obligatory: *Never use old grocery store jars for canning things.*</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I realize that if the power goes out, you lose your work, but for buying and saving things when they are in season and on sale, it's an excellent prep method that people often overlook. </div>
