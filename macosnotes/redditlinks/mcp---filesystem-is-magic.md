<div><h1>MCP + Filesystem is magic</h1></div>

<div>I'm finding that MCP has been a game changer for my workflow, and basically made Projects obsolete for me. I've emptied my project files and only rely on projects for the prompt in my custom instructions. That's it.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\-It's made starting new conversations a breeze. It used to be a pain to update the files in the project to make sure Claude isn't working on old files. Problem solved: Claude can fetch updated versions whenever</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\-With proper prompting, Claude can quickly get the files HE needs to understand what's going on before continuing. This is much more efficient than me trying to figure out what he might or might not need for a specific conversation.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\- My limits have more than tripled because of more efficient use of the context. Nothing gets loaded in context unless Claude needs it so my conversations use fewer tokens, and the reduced friction to starting a new conversation means I start conversations more often making better use of the context. I have two accounts, and I'm finding less value for the second one at the moment because of the better efficiency.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\-Claude gets less overwhelmed and provides better answers because the context is limited to what it needs.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>If you're using Claude for coding and struggle with either:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\-&quotClaude is dumber than usual&quot: Try MCP. The dumber feel is usually because Claude's context is overwhelmed and loses the big picture. MCP helps this</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>\-&quotThe limits are absurd&quot: Try MCP. Trust me.</div>

<div>Can someone explain MCP to me? How are you using it? And what has it allowed you to do that you couldn’t do before?</div>

<div>Looking to catch up after seeing lots of posts talking about how they have transformed people’s Claude experience. Thanks for any info and guidance</div>
