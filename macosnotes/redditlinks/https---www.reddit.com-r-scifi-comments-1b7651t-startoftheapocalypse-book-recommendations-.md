<div> Start-of-the-apocalypse book recommendations?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>One of my favorite kinds of apocalypse stories is the kind where we START shortly before, or during the collapse of society. Things like 'The Stand' by Stephen King, or 'Swan Song' by Robert R. McCammon or even 'Bird Box' by Josh Malerman (I didn't watch the movie so no idea if its good). Movies like 28 Days Later (and even its sequel, to a degree) and shows like season one of the Walking Dead.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I tried 'Dies the Fire' by S. M. Stirling and absolutely hated it (it was an awesome idea but he dropped the ball on interesting character development, tension, and plot -- to me it read like a barely fleshed out outline) but read 'Any Sign of Life' by Rae Carson and ADORED it!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Anyone have an reccs in this vein? I've been really struggling to find more and my most recent re-read of 'Any Sign of Life' has me absolutely itching to find more like it and this subreddit has been absolutely amazing in helping me find scifi reccs before!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The books don't have to be as 'epic' are The Stand, or Swan Song -- I don't even need it to be Zombies -- I just want something that starts at the 'beginning' of an end of the world scenario.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>A female protagonist is preferred, but anything goes!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>EDIT:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Thank you all SO MUCH!! The people in this reddit have never failed to help me find things in the genre and I've collected such a wonderful collection of reccs to dive into!</div>
