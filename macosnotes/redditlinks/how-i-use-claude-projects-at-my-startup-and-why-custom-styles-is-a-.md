<div>Hey r/ClaudeAI community!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I’ve been working on Immurio for about a year now trying to zone in on the right problem to solve. I’d like to give back to the community by sharing how I’m using Claude to fill in some of my knowledge gaps. If you find this post useful, please lend me a hand by trying out Immurio Early Access at [app.immurio.com](https://app.immurio.com) and sharing your feedback.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># What do I use Claude for?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I’m a technical founder working in the climate and sustainability space. Like many others, I started out with no social media presence, nor a network in the startup ecosystem. I used LLMs to fill in my gaps in the early stages while I spent time building out my network. I continue to use Claude today because it still acts as a great sounding board that’s available 24/7.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># Claude vs ChatGPT</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Initially I used both ChatGPT and Claude free versions to brainstorm ideas and write code. Over time I came to prefer Claude because its answers just sounded more natural and easy to read. I paid for a subscription in March and with Claude Sonnet 3.5, I’ve never had to regret that decision.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I haven’t kept up with ChatGPT and its new features, but I’m sure you can make it work for you if that’s what you prefer. But in this post, I’ll focus on Claude.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># Claude Projects</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>In June, Anthropic released Claude Projects and this was an absolute game changer. I’ll cut to the chase and tell you the setup that’s been working for me:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I have a single Project called **Immurio Discussions** with the following documents in the knowledge base:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>1. **about\_company\_202411.md** \- Description of Immurio, its mission, list and qualifications of personnel, a timeline of the company, a roadmap and current challenges.</div>
<div>2. **decision\_log.md** \- A list of all technology, product, marketing, etc. decisions that we have made and the reasoning for each. This also describes the tech we’re using to build the product, e.g. Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, REST APIs.</div>
<div>3. **product\_strategy\_202411.md** \- A detailed description of the current project I’m working on for Immurio, with MVP features, UX, monetization strategy, KPIs and future direction.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>With this knowledge base, I can start a new chat within the project with *zero additional context*, be it writing code, marketing material or strategy discussions. I can jump in at any time and be productive immediately.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># Custom Prompts</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>As you already know, LLMs tend to have a certain way of writing, and are tuned to be general purpose (“You are a helpful assistant…”). But general doesn’t work great for us, so I ended up creating a few prompts for the various roles I interacted with the project as. There’s a Startup Advisor, a Marketing Expert, an Experienced Engineer, among others.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Custom prompting also lets you mitigate one of the most annoying things about LLMs – they want to agree with you and won’t argue with your version of events. Over time, I was able to create a prompt where Claude will sometimes stubbornly take an opposing view (“...I may have blind spots and I need you to see the things I can't...”, “...don't hesitate to challenge my assumptions...”)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I hand-crafted the above three prompts, and used Claude to come up with others (Product Designer, Early App User, Sustainability Expert) by providing examples. I can share some of my prompts in a future post if there’s interest.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># The new game changer – Custom Styles</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>My biggest pain point with my Projects setup was that I had to keep my prompts in a doc on my computer and copy-paste the most relevant one for each new chat. This was annoying to the point that I considered writing my own UI for Claude with multiple selectable personas.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Then, just last week, [Anthropic released](https://www.anthropic.com/news/styles) the Custom Styles feature. They market it as the ability to provide style examples to be followed, but you can actually set any custom prompt you want. This has been a huge productivity boost for me, and I can now just select my ‘Marketing Expert’, ‘Experienced Engineer’, etc. prompts right from the chat UI.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># Conclusion</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>In this post, I went over my Claude Projects setup and how the Custom Styles feature lets me move even faster. If you haven’t tried it out yet, give it a shot – you won’t be disappointed. Claude has helped me fill in blind spots and knowledge gaps when I hadn’t built out my network yet, and it’s a valuable tool for any new entrepreneur.</div>
