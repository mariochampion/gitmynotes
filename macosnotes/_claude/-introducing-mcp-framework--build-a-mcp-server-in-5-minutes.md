<div>Hey everyone! 🚀</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I've been building a few MCP servers lately, and I kept running into the same patterns over and over for creating tools or defining resources. I've been thinking hard about how to put these patterns together to make building MCP servers easier and more fun.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>So I am excited to introduce **MCP-Framework** \- the first TypeScript framework specifically for MCP Servers. No more boilerplate hell, no more reinventing the wheel. Just clean, fast server development.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Want to try it? You can literally **have your first server running in under 5 minutes (I timed it ⏱️).**</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>You can create you entire project with the cli command \`mcp create my-project\`. You can generate a tool with the cli, and then modify it to fit your liking.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I've put together some docs to get you started: [https://mcp-framework.com/](https://mcp-framework.com/)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Here is the Github repo - a star for visibility would mean a lot &amplt;3: [https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/mcp-framework](https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/mcp-framework)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This is just v1, and I'd love to hear what you think. What features would make your life easier? What's missing? Drop your thoughts in this thread or in Github issues!</div>
