<div><h1>Reddit fetch work</h1></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>good afternoon. lets do a batch process improvement next on the local file &quot/Users/mariochampion/Documents/gitmynotes/reddit_fetch.py”. In the main() function there is a &quottest_file&quot which points to one single file. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Rather than hard-code a test file, I would like an enhancement to “reddit_fetch.py” so that it look to file, “reddit_prefetched.yaml” in the same directory. “reddit_prefetched.yaml” lists files to process one per row under a section named after the directory it is in. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Does this make sense?</div>
