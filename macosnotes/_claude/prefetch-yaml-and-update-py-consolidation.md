<div><h1>Prefetch yaml and update py consolidation</h1></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I would like to consolidate &quotreddit_prefetched.yaml&quot into “gmn_config.yaml” to resolve the manual updating to make  &quotPREFETCH_BASE_DIR&quot match” DEFAULT_NOTES_WRAPPERDIR&quot</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I would like to keep reddit_update_prefetch.py as a separate file and use ruamel.yaml, like I do in gitmynotes.py to maintain the formatting and comments in gmn_config.yaml</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Can you make these changes to the files?</div>
