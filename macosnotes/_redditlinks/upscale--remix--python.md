<div>If I had to generate in that resolution I would probably use SD for making one third or one quarter of said resolution and use Gigapixel AI for upscaling. I have made a couple of impressive outer space backgrounds in 3440x1440 for my office machine by generating 1720x720 and upscaling by 2 with GPAI.

The pictures in the links were, as far as I can see, sharpened after upscaling, up to a point that the hair of the woman suffers from halos and double outlines. That would occur with GPAI as well if one pushed the sharpening (called "remove blur" in GPAI) beyond the sensible limits of that feature.</div>
