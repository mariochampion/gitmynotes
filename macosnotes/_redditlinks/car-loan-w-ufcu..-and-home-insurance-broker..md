<div>As the title says, I’m shopping for car insurance. I’m with progressive right now and it’s not precisely the cheapest. I’m looking for maybe local businesses that have better rates. Just for extra info, I’m 40 with 2 cars and with the option of bundle up with my home insurance. Thanks in advance. </div>

<div>Used to work in insurance. Shop rates but don’t do it online. Call a few offices because some
Companies like State Farm will never be included in brokers quotes. Call a few different and let them know you are shopping rates. The 1-800 and online quotes will get you a million phone calls from someone In a call center working on numbers games to hit quotas. 

My advice call an independent insurance broker- they can place and quote with multiple companies. 

Call State Farm - they are a mutual company, and brokers can’t quote their insurance. If you fit in their sweet spot your rates are fantastic. 

Check with USSA and other membership companies. Not everyone can qualify so your rates may show that. 

Most brokers can quote gieco progressive safeco liberty.

Bundling home and auto will give you a discount. 

ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS. Make sure the quotes are the same coverage. Lots of sales reps just want to get the sale and will slash coverage for this. Please for the life of me don’t take off the un/underinsured in Texas. You may think your car is a beater but I promise if you get hit but someone uninsured or you get it in a hit a run you will want this coverage. I’ve had to make an uninsured claim twice in Austin in 9 years of living here. 

Not all home owners insurance is the same. In fact it very drastically so by calling the office you can have them explain the discounts and coverage. Most companies don’t cover slow water leaks, and will deny claims for this. Most companies give new roof discounts that will decrease over the years raising your premiums.</div>
