<div>Yeah I know, probably not the brightest idea. But it's been fun testing it in a VM!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>My favorite experiment so far (outside the VM) was asking it to &quotgo through all the video files in my downloads folder and delete any compressed archives with duplicates.&quot Pretty nerve-wracking considering the number of files in there, I won't lie. Had to install 7zip myself after Claude's attempt triggered Windows Defender somehow. It was really thorough though, e.g. by asking me exactly what counted as a &quotduplicate&quot (same filename? size? include subfolders?). After clearing that up, it worked perfectly.</div>

<div>Use at your own risk! This thing could nuke your entire system... or worse.</div>

<div>Would love to hear if anyone has other crazy ideas or use cases for this!</div>
