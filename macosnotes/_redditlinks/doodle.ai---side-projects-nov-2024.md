<div>Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹<br></div>
<div>Iâ€™m always excited to see what other makers are building in the indie hacking and side project spaceâ€”such an inspiring community!</div>
<div>I'm buildingÂ <u>Signale.co</u>Â â€“ a tool designed to notify you the moment your chosen keywords are mentioned on Reddit.</div>
<div>Whether it's about yourÂ <b>brand</b>,Â <b>projects</b>, orÂ <b>topics youâ€™re passionate about</b>,Â <u>Signale.co</u>Â ensures you're always part of the conversation as it unfolds.</div>
<div>Curious to try it out? Iâ€™m looking for early adopters to help shape this tool. ðŸš€<br></div>
<div>If you're interested, join the waitlist on the website! Letâ€™s build something impactful together.</div>
