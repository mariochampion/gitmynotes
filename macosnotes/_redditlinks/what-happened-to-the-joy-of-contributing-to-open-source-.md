<div><h1>What happened to the joy of contributing to open-source?</h1></div>

<div>I'm an long time OSS maintainer and contributor (proof [https://github.com/buger](https://github.com/buger))</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Recently, I launched [helpwanted.dev](http://helpwanted.dev) — non profit platform to connect developers with active, small-scale open-source projects that need help. The idea is simple: fast feedback loops, meaningful contributions, and the opportunity to learn while making an impact.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>When I shared it on Reddit Learning to code subreddit, the first comment I received was disheartening: “Why bother with small open-source projects if there’s no career bonus?” It made me pause and reflect.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Have we forgotten the fun part? The joy of solving a problem, learning something new, or helping someone just because we can? Back in the early days of GitHub, it wasn’t about “what’s in it for me.” It was about exploration, growth, and being part of a global community.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Open source isn’t just a pathway to career benefits; it’s also an incredible way to rediscover the joy of building. When you contribute to a project, you’re not just helping others—you’re learning, improving, and staying curious. And sometimes, that’s enough.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>For me, it always comes back to the fun. I always juggled multiple side projects—not for fame or recognition—but because it was fun. It helped me grow, and it reminded me why I fell in love with this profession. And not everything needs be monetised!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you’re a developer—whether you’re just starting or well into your career—consider this: What could be better than helping with a real idea, contributing to an open-source project, or learning something new? Not for a bonus or a title, but simply out of the pure joy of doing it.</div>
