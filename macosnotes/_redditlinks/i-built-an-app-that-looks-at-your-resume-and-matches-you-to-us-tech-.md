<div>I tried 10+ job boards and was frustrated with irrelevant postings, so I built my own job board to give tailored job recommendations</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I'm using ML to look at the actual work experience (not just keywords) and rank job postings based on fit</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>It's **100% free with no ads** for ever as my infra costs are $0. i have no plans to monetize this</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I've been through the job search and I know its so brutal, so feel free to DM and I'm happy to give advice on your job search</div>
