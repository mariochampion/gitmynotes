<div>Cyril M. Kornbluth died young -- he was only 34, and for years before his death had been plagued by heart problems, caused in part by the stress of his service in World War II. The morning he died, he was on his way a job interview -- to become the editor of The Magazine of Fantasy &amp Science Fiction.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>He passed away in 1958, just before the &quotNew Wave&quot movement took hold in science fiction. I truly believe that if he had lived for just a few more years, he'd be remembered in the same breath as Phillip K Dick, Harlan Ellison, and Ursula K. Le Guin. He mostly wrote short stories for pulp magazines, but they all featured a depth of character and a complexity of world that I almost never see in other stories from his era.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>With These Hands is a heart-wrenching short story about a traditional sculptor grappling with the ethics and economics of AI art. Kornbluth wrote it in 1955, at a time when computers still ran on vacuum tubes.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>That Share of the Glory is about a far future monastic sect that reads Machiavelli's The Prince as a religious text. One of their monks is hired as a translator on a somewhat unscrupulous freighter. His first outing takes him to a planet that has no naturally occurring metals, where all technology is ceramic, and imports are tightly regulated to prevent total social upheaval.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Shark Ship is a post-apocalyptic story set on a boat populated by people who, due to an overpopulation crisis, have pledged to never set foot on land again. The setting and plot are great, but the real star are the relationships. The way characters who have lived their entire lives so close to each other and in such a rigid hierarchy come to understand each other is complex, subtle, and sometimes very sad.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Most of his stuff is totally forgotten today, and available only in the collection His Share of The Glory, but it's well worth tracking down. He's a phenomenal writer, and deeply, deeply underrated.<br></div>
