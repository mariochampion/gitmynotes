<div><h1>Python binary which runs everwhere</h1></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>I wanted to share some insights about an interesting project called [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) that I've been exploring.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># What is python-build-standalone?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The **python-build-standalone** project produces fully usable Python installations that include most extension modules from the standard library. The key feature here is that it minimizes runtime dependencies.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># Why Use It?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>1. **Portability**: The distributions are designed to work on any system for the targeted architecture, making it easier to deploy Python applications in diverse environments.</div>
<div>2. **Customizability**: Users can include build artifacts and rich metadata, which allows for downstream repackaging. This means you can create a custom Python distribution tailored to specific needs—great for embedding Python in larger binaries.</div>
<div>3. **Sister Project - PyOxy**: For those interested in enhancing their Python interpreter with Rust code, there's a related project called PyOxy that builds on these standalone distributions to create single-file executables.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># Getting Started</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you’re interested in trying out python-build-standalone, you can find the documentation [here](https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/). The documentation provides detailed instructions on how to build your own standalone Python distributions and includes examples of how to customize your builds.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div># Use Cases</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This tool is particularly beneficial for:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>* Developers who need to distribute applications without requiring users to install Python or additional libraries.</div>
<div>* Projects that aim for a minimal footprint on user systems.</div>
<div>* Scenarios where embedding Python within other applications is necessary.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Happy coding!</div>
