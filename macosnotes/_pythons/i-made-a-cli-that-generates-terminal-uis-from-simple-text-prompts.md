<div><h1>I made a CLI that generates terminal UIs from simple text prompts</h1></div>

<div>**What my project does:** </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Describe a terminal UI (TUI) in natural language (e.g., &quotMake me a dashboard for managing my Docker containers&quot), and an LLM will design and implement it within 1-2 minutes.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>**Target Audience:** </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Anyone building a TUI would benefit from this since it helps you quickly bootstrap or prototype one. But it's also useful as a general-purpose terminal assistant since a lot of tasks are best solved with an interface (e.g., &quotShow me which ports are currently active&quot).</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>**Comparison:** </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>As far as I know, this is the first project to implement generative UI in the terminal. The concept of generating UI from text prompts has been around for the last year and is popular in the web development space (see [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)) but nonexistent in the world of terminals.</div>
