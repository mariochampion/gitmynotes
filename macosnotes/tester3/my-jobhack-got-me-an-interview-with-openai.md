<div>Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat this. I had been firing off countless resumes into the black hole of online applications, only to hear crickets. So when I saw a role at OpenAI that was practically tailor-made for my skill set, I decided to go all in.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I built a software tool that scans job descriptions for top keywords. Then, in under 2 minutes, I fine-tuned my resume with that language. Not spamming—just making sure I was speaking the same language as the automated filters and recruiters. I also tweaked a few bullet points with help from ChatGPT and Gemini. A few days later, I got an email from a recruiter wanting to set up an interview!!.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The takeaway here is pretty straightforward: If you want your resume to shine, you have to align it with the job description. It's not glamorous, but it works.  I'm getting tons of success with this method getting lots of interviews (and some offers already)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you’re curious about the tool I made or just want to talk strategy, drop a comment or shoot me a DM.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Stay relentless, folks.</div>
