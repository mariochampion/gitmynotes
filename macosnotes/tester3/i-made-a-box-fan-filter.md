<div><h1>I made a box fan filter </h1></div>
<div>recently but I reasoned that just one filter on the back side might restrict air flow too much and burn out the motor so I instead bought 5 and created a big box with 5 sides being filters and sixth side the fan. Just make sure your four sides share one dimension of your fan and the end filter matches your fan. So 20x20&quot fan I did four 20x24&quot and one 20x20&quot because for some reason 20x24&quot was cheaper.</div>
