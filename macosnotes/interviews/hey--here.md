<div>hey @here</div>

<div>Whew! With the release of 4.21.0 and 4.21.1 you may have noticed me pushing more and more question to me towards nehal. Well, the good news is those are last releases which i co-lead, as nehal is ready to be full-on release manager!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>So please direct your questions to Nehal on drafting the release notes and coordinating their re-structuring, making sure docs has a version for the website, making sure the docker and javadocs and XSDs are available, statuses of the OSS and Pro extensions, and all the many and sundry elements that go into a successful and complete Liquibase release.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>You got this nehal!</div>
