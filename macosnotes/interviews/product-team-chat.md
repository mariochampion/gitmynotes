<div>16 may 2022</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>For enterprise product: get it back into mainstream sales </div>
<div>Mike and mike lead with enterprise and back into pro if needed.</div>
<div>Erin does the opposite</div>
<div>Late net or org with large relational footprint</div>
<div>Ben has a huge backlog. Then expand for relational DBs on prem?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b><u>Onboarding in ALL products s very much needed. </u></b><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Yesterdays push is more continuum like, and Brian not on board with that/</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>PRO/EMPIRE should be collapsed into one sweet spot between css and enterprise, cloud focused and modern, need to prove a AWS focus. Could be a cloud motion. Will it ever talk to on-prem who is that up to? What is hosting looking like? We could limit to AWS at least at first.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>“I believe” the cicd motion in amazon or unstructured , s some continuum motions might be still true but not inherently.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We don’t want to cannibalize enterprise an especially if you have migration tooling etc and 100 drop in parity is a problem we wouldn’t be able to avoid.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>hypothesis: There is still a need in the enterprise space, but we need to generate more rev in a new space that is more agile, community based, and that’s maybe AWS</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>(Look at job reccs to get a gauge of what people are doing now, and planning to do)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>“We gotta quit trying to do it all” — Brian	</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Alternate: do people want bridge products?? Or? GCP or azure? </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>What are our PLG / inside sales metrics?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>——</div>
<div>What is in new product?</div>
<ul>
<li>How to make oss less lead gen, and more a strategic weapon that builds more.</li>
<ul>
<li>Meeting tech specs, qa specs, etc</li>
<li>Frameworks and SDKs and extensions with examples and get the comm to build it.</li>
<li>Do we have evidence this is viable with OUR community?</li>
<ul>
<li>Can we find great close examples?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>NEW PAID PRODUCT</li>
<ul>
<li>Unstructured next? Mongo etc</li>
<ul>
<li>Is there a diff zdevops motions we need to know first — yes</li>
</ul>
<li>AWS specific probably</li>
<li>Hold off QC 3 until we know more</li>
<ul>
<li>Do we know QCs are the reasons people but it?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<ul>
<li>What PLG<i>-like</i> motion do we have?</li>
<ul>
<li>What is the pull we see that QCS provide to pull people from oss to pro</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<ul>
<li>How can we track the flow from single user of oss to teams with PRO?</li>
<ul>
<li>Is a split among checks make a difference?</li>
</ul>
<li><i>Not </i>packaging, but the new birth of that value</li>
<ul>
<li>So called whatever, but use resources that would have gone to QCs to make that happen</li>
</ul>
<li>Onboarding and UI onto of Pro?</li>
<ul>
<li>When you move to a team do you get a UI?</li>
<li>Is Hub the place for that?</li>
<li>Pivot to an AWS-optimized solution, at least first.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Do we have the silver bullet? The 1,2,3 things that no one else is solving? Is this a tactical interest? Do we look past DBs? Or even look at other types of DBs? Diagnostics and strategic hep to make you better at __secure repeatable data deployments__??_AI/ML?____</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>What about integrations? Can community deliver?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>OSS == deliver to developers so ONE of them can be successful (??)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Have we fully validated a pivot? And if so what are the silver bullets?</div>
<ul>
<li>how do we answer this now</li>
<li>How would we answer this aspirationally </li>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>What is PLG success? What is enterprise success?</div>
<div>What is the greenfield?</div>
<div>Validating QCs, unstructured, etc</div>
<div><br></div>
