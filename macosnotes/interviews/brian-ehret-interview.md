<div><h1>Brian Ehret interview</h1></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b>What do you know overall about what we re building?</b><br></div>
<div>How much do you know about Liquibase and devop, data collection/data feeds?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b>personal fit and ability to work with the candidate</b><br></div>
<div>(Just get to know him a bit)</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b>ability to understand or brainstorm concepts we are facing, </b><br></div>
<div>i like this: “system management applications; applications for</div>
<div>configuring complex systems like LDAP servers, telephony systems,</div>
<div>identity management platforms, enterprise license managers and</div>
<div>natural gas processing systems.”</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>that is, I see you designed the input set ups for systems, do you know what happened with the output side? The collecting data, providing data feeds, generating stories for different personas, etc?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b>preferences in the way they work.</b><br></div>
<div>The remote and agile/hybrid is good (that’s what we do) and understood.</div>
<div>can you talk about getting into actually building UIs, an app, and wiring all together, the kinds and levels of collaboration, the cycles of development on the way to a public release, etc? What do you like, dislike, hope for, need from us? Etc</div>
