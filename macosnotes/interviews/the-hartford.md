<div>On-prem remains the same</div>
<div>In cloud will use ONLY all cloud native tools, and all automated and no manual requests to DBA queue</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Can we get an ROI productivity case study from The Hartford and publish it? Around Liquibase + UCD + ____???____</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Something to get more Hartford teams to be aware?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Publish internal has already been done to every app area. Management has been made aware multiple times for EDM goals and other app owners know how liquibase has benefitted them. And also with vendors.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Maybe ask Ryan (app owner) or Devin?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Meet again in a month!</div>
