<div>——————————————————————————————————————</div>
<div>What of PO for Dan?</div>
<ul>
<li>Can’t be too junior, as that is less likely to have seen multiple tool integration/use cases and worked thru the issues</li>
<li>should have direct experience in tool space.</li>
<ul>
<li>Not just dev tools tho, Ops space with dev use cases also works</li>
<li>any tool space with multiple integrations would be great</li>
</ul>
<li>someone who can’t be run over by people with way more experience</li>
<ul>
<li>but also not so late career, too long in the wrong space that make it hard to believe their mindset is so easily fits into ours</li>
<li>so not from the “Dino world”, altho maybe there are some areas in there are viable</li>
</ul>
<li>dream candidate: Multiple standardized integrations, can make it repeatable and scalable, since that is what we want to do</li>
<ul>
<li>Super dream: dealing with DBs and APIs as well.</li>
<ul>
<li>Data integration depth of knowledge which will reduce the learning curve for sure</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>as close to direct experience of this job as practical, is how i read this.</li>
</ul>
